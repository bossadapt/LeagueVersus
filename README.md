League Versus

This coding project is a discord bot that can help with Inhouse games balance teams or be randomly sorted teams for a League of Legends match. It does this by verifying your league account and storing it in a MySQL database. The matchmaking is based on league account rate and rank.  The match participation is based on replies to match requests.
