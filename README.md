League Versus

This coding project is a discord bot that can help with Inhouse games balance teams or be randomly sorted teams for a league of legends match. It does this by verifying your league account and stores it in a mysql database. The matchmaking is based of league account winrate and rank. The match participation is based on replies to match requests.
